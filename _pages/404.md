<div style="font-size: 1.4em;">
Once upon a morning dreary,<br>
After I swam, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of code galore,<br>
At my desk, nearly napping, suddenly I heard a tapping,<br>
A request for a page that was not there before.<br>
"Tis a visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my server's door -<br>
Page not found, 404."
</div>
