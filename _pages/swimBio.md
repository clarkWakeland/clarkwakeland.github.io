### Intro
*This was originally a much longer write-up, but I decided to condense it and give the full history it's own blog post, which I am currently working on.*

My history with swimming is long and certainly wasn't perfect, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. The people I've met and experiences I've gained have all made me a better, more complete person. 


### High School (2014-2018)
I swam in high school for [Westlake High School](https://whs.eanesisd.net/) and trained with [Lost Creek Aquatics](https://www.capitalareaaquatics.com/page/home) (now Capital Area Aquatics) and later [Austin Swim Club](https://www.usms.org/clubs/austin-swim-club-2581?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwm_SzBhAsEiwAXE2Cv0xPgP_8BomvqGDmUqCKUXpB55unLJx3iZho0ftc7rS2ovWxUYxU-xoCbEsQAvD_BwE).

### College (2018-2023)
I swam at [Georgia Tech](https://ramblinwreck.com/sports/c-swim/) while pursuing my bachelor's degree and did a fifth year at [Michigan](https://mgoblue.com/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving) while pursuing my master's degree. I competed at meets like NCAA Championships, US Olympic Team Trials, and had the opportunity to race Olympic gold medalists and national record holders.

I improved significantly at Georgia Tech and then had a not so great year (performance wise) at Michigan. I had an amazing time at both places and made friends I'll be connected to forever.

*This was the most significant part of my career but I'll leave most of the details for the full post. My friend and former teammate Kevin Fang has a great post about swimming in college [here](https://fourcontext.com/index.php/2022/02/pros-and-cons-of-being-a-college-swimmer/).*

### Post Grad (2023-2024)
I got a career opportunity in the San Francisco Bay Area and discovered it might be feasible for me to train for one more year. I swam with [Alto Swim Club](https://altoswimclub.com/) at Stanford while working as an engineer full time. There were about five other post grads training in that group which was nice because we kept each other in check with training despite our "adult" responsibilities.

### Present (2024-)
I now swim with [Stanford Masters Swimming](https://web.stanford.edu/group/masters/) and have gotten more into open water races. I even won an [Alcatraz swim](https://www.itsyourrace.com/Results.aspx?amax=199&amin=0&eid=122546&g=A&id=8078&y=2023) (And SwimSwam even wrote an [article](https://swimswam.com/ryan-murphy-competes-in-sharkfest-alcatraz-swim/) about it).

I'm currently training for a triathlon in Santa Cruz this September and I've gotten more into running and biking.
