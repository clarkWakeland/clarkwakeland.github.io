### Intro

My history with swimming is long, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I tried to keep this summary brief because the full story is much longer. In many ways I think swimming is a reflection of real life - sometimes it's hard to understand why you failed one time and succeeded another, and it's the people you meet that really make it all worth it.


### High School (2014-2018)
I swam in high school for [Westlake High School](https://whs.eanesisd.net/) and trained with [Lost Creek Aquatics](https://www.capitalareaaquatics.com/page/home) (now Capital Area Aquatics) and later [Austin Swim Club](https://www.usms.org/clubs/austin-swim-club-2581?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwm_SzBhAsEiwAXE2Cv0xPgP_8BomvqGDmUqCKUXpB55unLJx3iZho0ftc7rS2ovWxUYxU-xoCbEsQAvD_BwE).

### College (2018-2023)
I swam at [Georgia Tech](https://ramblinwreck.com/sports/c-swim/) while pursuing my bachelor's degree and did a fifth year at [Michigan](https://mgoblue.com/sports/mens-swimming-and-diving) while pursuing my master's degree. I competed at meets like NCAA Championships, US Olympic Team Trials, and had the opportunity to race Olympic gold medalists and national record holders.

There's a lot to say about swimming in college, but it honestly deserves it's own post. The crux of it is this: I went from a shy, nerdy, good-but-not-great swimmer to a more confident, even nerdier, and genuinely great swimmer.
*My friend and former teammate Kevin Fang also has a great post about swimming in college [here](https://fourcontext.com/index.php/2022/02/pros-and-cons-of-being-a-college-swimmer/).*

### Post Grad (2023-2024)
I got a career opportunity in the San Francisco Bay Area and determined it would be feasible to train for one more year. I swam with [Alto Swim Club](https://altoswimclub.com/) at Stanford while working as an engineer full time. There were about five other post grads training in that group which was nice because we kept each other in check with training despite our "adult" responsibilities.

### Present (2024-)
I now swim with [Stanford Masters Swimming](https://web.stanford.edu/group/masters/) and have gotten more into open water races. I even won an [Alcatraz swim](https://www.itsyourrace.com/Results.aspx?amax=199&amin=0&eid=122546&g=A&id=8078&y=2023) (And SwimSwam wrote an [article](https://swimswam.com/ryan-murphy-competes-in-sharkfest-alcatraz-swim/) about it).

I'm currently running, lifting, and getting back into skiing after a ten year hiatus.
