### Getting my feet wet
I've been swimming for as long as I can remember. So long, in fact, I do not remember a time when I didn't know how to swim. 

Like many others, I was introduced to swimming because my parents wanted me to feel safe around water. Somewhere along the line I ended up joining a club around age 11-12 and was swimming everyday. I wasn't particularly good at this point, but gliding through the water was the most fun part of swimmming to me. Overall, I wasn't really enjoying the sport at this point and almost quit on multiple occasions. 

My family moved to Austin and for some reason we decided not to join a club but instead to swim 3x1500s everyday at the UT rec center. Saying this was boring would be an understatment. It was monotonous and

### High School (The kiddie pool)
My freshman year of high school was my first true exposure to the "team" aspect of swimming (or "team" aspect of anything, for that matter). I consider myself a pretty quiet person, but back then I hardly talked to anyone. Being surrounded by 20 or so other guys really allowed me to open up. Initially it seemed scary, but over time I was able to find my niche and make friends with teammates over interests outside of swimming. 

I began by purely going to high school practices. Our schedule was five days a week in the afternoon for about an hour each practice. Despite being in a relatively affluent area, our school did not have a pool, and we instead used a local neighborhood complex. These practices were much more varied than the training I had previously been doing, and I soon found myself starting to improve quickly. At the end of the high school season (Febuary), I had been talking to a few teammates who were club swimmers, and they all recommended that I join a club if I wanted to continue getting better. 

#### Club swimming
This is a good time to give some background on how swimming works at the age group level (around ages 12-18) and in high school. Unlike other, more popular sports such as football, basketball, and baseball, the high school team is generally *not* the most serious or premiere place to train at this level. High school sports in Texas are limited to one practice a day for a maximum of around an hour and a half while in-season, which for swimming was about September to February. Club programs, however, have no such limit. They often have two or three doubles (two practices in one day) in a week around two hours in length, everyday of the week except Sunday, for the entire year. What tends to happen is the high school team will only have one required practice a week where everyone on the team must show up, and the club swimmers are considered exempt from the other practices because they are assumed to be training with their club team everyday.

So the natural question is, why would club swimmers even bother with the high school team? There are a few reasons, but to put it briefly, the state championships of high school swimming, at least in Texas, is still a very competitive event and offers club swimmers another opportunity to compete at a high level. There is also a slightly greater sense of pride in swimming for a school team as opposed to a club team.

### College (The Grown Up Pool)
I could probably write a whole dissertation on my experience swimming in college (in fact, that might be the subject of a later post).

### Post Grad (The Deep End)

### Present (Open water)
My current goal is training triathlons. I still swim masters at Stanford as often as I can but it's nice not to have the lingering pressure of having to consistently make every practice. If I want to sleep in, or if I'm just not feeling great in the water that day, it's no big deal. The stake
