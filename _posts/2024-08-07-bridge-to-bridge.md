## The Waves

I've completed and now won my second swim in the SF Bay: a 10k from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge.

This race was quite nice because instead of swimming in laps around buoys like a traditional open water race, most of the swim was *with* the current. 
The waves on the ocean side of the Golden Gate bridge were incredibly choppy, but immediately smoothed out on the bay side, as if passing into a sea of tranquility. Once we were in the water, it was quick start. We were instructed to head towards Alcatraz at first and then make a sharp right towards the Palace of Fine Arts to catch the current above SF.

I remember the moment I caught the current - it honestly felt like I was body surfing. Aside from the supermassive container ship coming up behind me (which I heard before I saw), the swim was mostly uneventful. I had a fantastic view of the city skyline from the water. When I made it to the end, they hadn't even put up the finish buoy yet.

## The Battles
I was less than four minutes off the course record, but didn't really have any strong feelings about breaking it/not breaking it. I had felt sluggish in the pool for the past few days and honestly after about 20 minutes of the swim I felt more fatigue than expected in my upper body. I think my lack of full time training is finally catching up, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to not have to swim 20 hours a week. 

Breakfast afterwards at the Buena Vista Cafe near Aquatic Park in SF was the perfect conclusion :)
