The vast majority of testing done with our satellite involves sending commands and observing the it's response via telemetry that it downlinks. Unfortunately, the satellite downlink bandwidth is simply not large enough to recieve every single telemetry in a reasonable amount of time. Instead, transmissions are divided into things calld **frames** and **subframes**.
