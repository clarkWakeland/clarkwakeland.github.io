\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\# !DevonGeoSat-2 error report! \#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#

-- Cause: Spacecraft experienced off nominal attitude measurements - entering safemode

-- Dumping event log...

Timestamp t = [ENCYRPTED - ONYX SCHEME E7B4C1F2]

[t+0] - unexpected object (designated A0) in detected in near orbit radius, does not match any craft in ephemeris

[t+2] - sending report to Hoenn Space Agency...

[t+2] - A0 distance decreasing. Probability of collision >50%, performing emergency slew and inclination burn

[t+15] - slew complete, begin burn

[t+23] - burn complete

[t+25] - reassesment of A0 shows change in trajectory matching new orbit

[t+30] - distance to A0 significantly decreasing (Approach rate >50 m/s). Probability of impact >90%. Time to impact 14 seconds.

[t+32] - slewing to face A0, attempting to resolve...

[t+34] - error - cannot resolve. A0 moving too fast to acquire. Calculated necessary torques would exceed limits of vehicle structure and reaction wheels

[t+43] - A0 has haulted relative movement <2m from vehilce

[t+46] - !!WARNING!! Unexpected demate of primary OBC radiation panel 

[t+48] - !!CRITICAL ERROR!! Unknown write directly to EEPROM

[t+55] - super user access granted. Dumping Hoenn Space Agency ephemeris...

[t+72] - dump complete
