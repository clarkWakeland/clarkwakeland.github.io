The waves on the ocean side of the Golden Gate bridge were incredibly choppy, but immediately smoothed out on the bay side, as if passing into a sea of tranquility. Once we were in the water, it was quick start. We were instructed to head towards Alcatraz at first and then make a sharp right towards the Palace of Fine Arts to catch the current above SF.</p> <p>I remember the moment I caught the current - it honestly felt like I was body surfing. Aside from the supermassive container ship coming up behind me (which I heard before I saw), the swim was mostly uneventful. I had a fantastic view of the city skyline from the water. When I made it to the end, they hadn’t even put up the finish buoy yet. <br/><br/></p> <h2 id="the-battles">The Battles</h2> <p>I was less than four minutes off the course record, but didn’t really have any strong feelings about breaking it/not breaking it. I had felt sluggish in the pool for the past few days and honestly after about 20 minutes of the swim I felt more fatigue than expected in my upper body. I think my lack of full time training is finally catching up, but it’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make to not have to swim 20 hours a week.</p> <p>Breakfast afterwards at the Buena Vista Cafe near Aquatic Park in SF was the perfect conclusion :)</p> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col"></div> <div class="col-8"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/postSwim-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/postSwim-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/postSwim-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/postSwim.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="The water here was pretty questionable.

The voyage is well known for being the first to circumnavigate the Earth. Although Magellan himself did not survive to complete the journey, his name is synonymous with global navigation, exploration, and human tenacity.</p> <p>Because of this, I introduce the epynomous Magellan Swim Challenge: swimming a distance approximately equal to the circumference of the Earth - 24,901 miles (40,075 km).</p> <p>In reality, Magellan’s expedition covered almost 60,000 miles. But for the sake of the challenge, I chose to set a number that represents the shear act of encircling the globe just by swimming. Plus, you can create a swim route that is nearly the same distance (if you’re alright with a quick swim through the Panama Canal).</p> <p>I’m not aware of anyone who has officially completed this yet, but I have a couple likely guesses: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beno%C3%AEt_Lecomte">Benoît Lecomte</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Strel">Martin Strel</a>.</p> <h2 id="personal-progress">Personal Progress</h2> <p>I did not officially record all the practices of my competitive swimming career, but I believe a very conservative estimate is 11,000 miles. As of July 2024, I belive I have swam</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <h3 id="distance">11365 miles</h3> </div> <p>in my life. On the interactive globe below, the green path represents the distance I have swam so far, and the red path represents the distance I have left to go. The overall path follows a hypothetical circumnavigation starting in the San Francisco Bay and crossing through the Panama Canal on the way back.</p> <div id="content-window" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; "> <canvas id="canvas_ID"></canvas> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="swimming"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swimming around the world]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introductions</title><link href="https://clarkwakeland.github.io/blog/2024/intro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introductions"/><published>2024-05-29T18:57:41+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-29T18:57:41+00:00</updated><id>https://clarkwakeland.github.io/blog/2024/intro</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://clarkwakeland.github.io/blog/2024/intro/"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Threading Water, a blog about swimming, engineering, and the surprising intersections I’ve found between them. I’ll cover topics including but not limited to: competitive swimming, my experience in the aerospace industry, and the lessons I’ve learned in both of them. Most of the statements and examples in these posts will be purely anecdotal, but I’ll reference sources whenever possible. Most posts involving training techniques or mentality will be about swimming but can be applied to any sport or craft someone is trying to master.</p> <p>The blog has multiple goals:</p> <p>First, I want to share the thoughts in my head rather than leave them internalized. I’ve found out that keeping ideas to yourself, even if you think they’re not great in the moment, can actually lead to missed opportunities, slower progress, and suboptimal solutions to problems you’re encountering. This blog is an attempt to change that personal policy I’ve found myself following for too long.</p> <p>Second, I believe that my background in swimming and engineering has provided me with unique blend of insights. The overlap of highly competitive swimmers and passionate engineers is (unsurprisingly) not very large, yet I find myself applying ideas I learned in one domain to other all the time.</p> <p>Finally, I want to help people think in different ways. I spent this past winter volunteering as a teacher for high school students, and the satisfaction I felt when I saw a student gain an understanding of concept by approaching it in a new way was amazing. If even just one person were to read these posts and learn something valuable, I would consider that an overwhelming success.</p> <p>My hope is that someone somewhere will be able to take away something from these posts.
